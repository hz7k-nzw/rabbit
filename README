This package contains the code for the SCHEME interpreter and
the RABBIT compiler from the Steele & Sussman "lambda papers"
(http://library.readscheme.org/page1.html), with a few minor
changes made by Kenji Nozawa, so that it would work under a
toy lisp system written in Java.

rabbit/scheme.lisp
 LISP code for the SCHEME interpreter by Gerald Jay Sussman and
 Guy Lewis Steele, Jr.. [1]

 This source code includes the detailed page-by-page notes on the
 code in the original paper, and also includes the code for macro
 by Darius Bacon (http://wry.me/), which is not included in the
 original paper.

rabbit/AIM-349.scm
 Example SCHEME code from the same paper. [1]

rabbit/rabbit.scm
 SCHEME code for the RABBIT compiler by Guy Lewis Steele, Jr.. [2]

 This source code is taken from the CMU Scheme Repository
 (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/scheme/impl/rabbit/)
 and I transcribed the detailed page-by-page notes included in the
 original paper into the above file.

rabbit/fact.scm
rabbit/fib.scm
rabbit/hello.scm
 Example SCHEME code

rabbit/sample_output/fact.lisp
rabbit/sample_output/fib.lisp
rabbit/sample_output/hello.lisp
 Example output emitted by the RABBIT compiler

== Getting Started

1. Download LAPIN (a toy lisp system written in Java)
You can download the source distribution from the following URL:

http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~hz7k-nzw/lapin/

and then extract the .tar.gz file by the following command:

$ gzip -dc lapin-<version>-src.tar.gz | tar xf -

2. Build LAPIN
Execute the following commands:

$ pwd
/PATH/TO/LAPIN_PRJ

'/PATH/TO/LAPIN_PRJ' denotes a path to the directory in which
the source distribution is extracted.

$ ant dist

This will create files for the binary distribution in the 'dist' directory.

3. Download scheme.tar.gz
You can download 'scheme.tar.gz' from the following URL:

http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~hz7k-nzw/lapin/scheme.tar.gz

Put the .tar.gz file in the 'dist' directory
and then execute the following command:

$ gzip -dc scheme.tar.gz | tar xf -

4. Run LAPIN, SCHEME, and RABBIT
Execute the following commands:

$ pwd
/PATH/TO/LAPIN_PRJ/dist

$ bin/lapin.sh 
hello!

;;; 4-1. Compile and load the SCHEME interpreter.
USER> (load (compile-file "rabbit/scheme"))

T

;;; 4-2. Run the SCHEME interpreter.
;;; This will activate the SCHEME interpreter under LAPIN.
USER> (scheme)

This is SCHEME xxx running in LISP yyy
SCHEME -- Toplevel

;;; 4-3. Load the RABBIT compiler in the SCHEME environment.
==> (aload "rabbit/rabbit.scm")

T 

;;; 4-4. Load the example
==> (aload "rabbit/fact.scm")

T 

==> fact

(BETA (LAMBDA (N) (IF (= N 0) 1 (* N (FACT (- N 1))))) NIL) 

==> (fact 5)  

120 

;;; 4-5. Compile the example.
==> (comfile "rabbit/fact.scm") ; output: rabbit/fact.lisp

; beginning rabbit compilation on "rabbit/fact.scm"
(FACT COMPILED) 
(FACT-ITER COMPILED) 
(|init-rabbit/fact| COMPILED) 
(COMPILE TIME 9 SECONDS) 

;;; 4-6. Execute the example.

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;; SORRY, UNDER CONSTRUCTION ;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;; type Ctrl-D to exit SCHEME
==> [This will exit SCHEME interpreter with eof-error]

;;; type Ctrl-D to exit LAPIN
USER> ^D
bye!
